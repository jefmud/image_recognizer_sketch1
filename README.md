# image_recognizer_sketch1

Image recognizer sketch 1 (still needs refinement to adapt to my scenario)

major credit to Adrian Rosebok (totally recommend reading his books)

I adapted this idea from:

  1. Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Adrian Rosebock (2018)
  2. Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks
  3. Practical Python and Open CV 4rth edition, Adrian Rosebock
