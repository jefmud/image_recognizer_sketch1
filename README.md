# image_recognizer_sketch1

Image recognizer sketch 1 (still needs refinement to adapt to my scenario).  I borrowed the Google image dowloader code from Hardik Vassas excellent project (https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download).  This downloader allows us to "bootstrap" our dataset for model training and program testing.  This project ultimately will not use this since we have very extensive human-identified dataset to train our model.

major credit to Adrian Rosebok (totally recommend reading his books)

I adapted this idea from:

  1. Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Adrian Rosebock (2018)
  2. Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks
  3. Practical Python and Open CV 4rth edition, Adrian Rosebock
